What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git 
For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but don’t want it to be committed yet, 
run git reset 

lesson_2_reflections.txt and the file will be removed from the staging area, 
but it will still be in your working directory.
